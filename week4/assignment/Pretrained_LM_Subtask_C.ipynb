The task aims to evaluate whether a system can distinguish if a natural language statement makes sense to humans or not and provide a reason. **ConVE** includes three subtasks that require models to acquire and apply commonsense knowledge. In this notebook you will focus on **SubTask C**:\n",

The [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) allows you to explore all the models supported by **Transformers** and even share your own models with the community.
