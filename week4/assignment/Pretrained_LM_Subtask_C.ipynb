        "In this assignment, you will work on the [ComVE](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/21080) shared task that was part of SemEval-2020. The task aims to evaluate whether a system can distinguish if a natural language statement makes sense to humans or not and provide a reason. **ConVE** includes three subtasks that require models to acquire and apply commonsense knowledge. In this notebook you will focus on **SubTask C**:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Given a statement that does not make sense, generate the reason why this statement does not make sense. For each nonsensical statement, three valid reasons are given as reference:\n",
        "\n",
        "     *Statement*: He put an elephant into the fridge.  \n",
        "     *Reason A*: An elephant is much bigger than a fridge.  \n",
        "     *Reason B*: A fridge is much smaller than an elephant.  \n",
        "     *Reason C*: Most of the fridges aren't large enough to contain an elephant.\n",
        "\n",
        "     This subtask can be approached as a Sequence-to-Sequence problem where the input is the nonsensical statement and the output is a valid reason.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will fine-tune a Pre-trained Language Model with [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) library that provides a set of tools for fine-tunning and deploying a wide variety of Pre-trained Language Models. The [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) allows you to explore all the models supported by **Transformers** and even share your own models with the community. In this assignment, you will work with [BART](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bart), a pre-trained Sequence-to-Sequence model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fine-tuning a Pre-trained Language Model usually requires a great amount of time and computational resources. Your personal computer will not be enough. In order to complete the assignment, you can work with a reduced version of the dataset and the base version of **BART**:"

This causes that different training runs of the same model can lead to different results. To ensure reproducibility, i.e. obtaining the same results in the different runs, the random number generator must be initialized with a fixed value known as seed.
